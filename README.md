# hello-world
just a repository


Hi Humans 

this is kinda my first commit
My name is Sihle Nxasane Currently a 3rd year Computer Science Student

Now this is the second edit, am about to test it again one more time
just to see if this really sinks in. this whole idea of branchies is really great.
i honestly think Github is a great plaform for all programmers.
or at least the best version control system for coding projects.
even though it can effectively do other file types but it does an incredible job in managing progress of large programming projects
and keeping track of the granular improvements done by contributors
